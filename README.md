## Anti-Trash YouTube
Eliminates trashy videos, channels, and features from the user's feeds, so that the experience is more enjoyable.
## Anti-Trash Reddit:
Reduces the visibility of garbage content (shitty subreddits, reposts, and unnecessary features), without infringing on content itself, so that the experience to the user is much more enjoyable. Currently only new reddit has a filter list. Eventually, old reddit will also get an anti-trash filter list.
