# anti-cancer-filter-lists
Blacklist cancer (figurative) on sites so you can have an enjoyable experience. Works for uBlock Origin users only.
## Anti-Trash YouTube
Eliminates trashy videos, channels, and features from the user's feeds, so that the experience is more enjoyable.
## Anti-Trash Reddit
Reduces the visibility of garbage content (shitty subreddits, reposts, and unnecessary features), without infringing on content itself, so that the experience to the user is much more enjoyable. Currently only new reddit has a filter list. Eventually, old reddit will also get an anti-trash filter list.
## Anti-Scam Internet
Blocks scam websites and removes them from search recommendations in search engines Duckduckgo and Google.
## Anti-Trash News
Blocks news sites that fake/sensationalize news, and removes them from search recommendations of Duckduckgo and Google. News sites made by conspiracy theorists are included as well. Satirical news sites will not be included; use the Anti-Satirical News filter list for that.
